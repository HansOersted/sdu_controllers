Getting started

To get started with using sdu_controllers, you need to install it on your system. See
:ref:`Installation <installation>`.

First steps
===========
sdu_controllers needs to be used in conjunction with either a robot simulator or robot manipulator.
Typically the controllers are part of a control loop that sends target positions to a robot with
a given frequency.

.. tabs::

   .. code-tab:: c++

         int main(const int argc, const char **argv) {
           return 0;
         }

   .. code-tab:: py

         def main():
             return
