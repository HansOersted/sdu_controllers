Getting started

To get started with using sdu_controllers, you need to install it on your system. See
:ref:`Installation <installation>`.

First steps
===========
sdu_controllers needs to be used in conjunction with either a robot simulator or robot manipulator.
Typically the controllers are part of a control loop that sends target positions to a robot with
a given frequency.

============================================

.. tab-set::
   :sync-group: lang

   .. tab-item:: C++
      :sync: linux

      .. code:: c++

         int main(const int argc, const char **argv)
         {
              return 0;
         }

   .. tab-item:: Python
      :sync: windows

      .. code:: python

         def main():
            return
