Getting started
***************

To get started with using sdu_controllers, you first need to install it on your system. See
:ref:`Installation <installation>`.

First steps
===========
sdu_controllers implements a fundamental joint-space motion controller. By using this controller it will allow the robot to follow an arbitrary joint-space trajectory, within the defined limits of the robots.

First a trajectory must be generated. For the sake of the example we choose two arbitrary joint positions.

Example with Breeding Blanket Handling Robot
============================================

.. tabs::

   .. code-tab:: c++

         int main(const int argc, const char **argv) {
           return 0;
         }

   .. code-tab:: py

         def main():
             return
